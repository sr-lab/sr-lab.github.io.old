# Password Quality
A number of utilities we use for research into password quality/strength are listed below.

## Ampasamp
Ampasamp (**a** **m**inimal **pa**ssword **samp**ler) is a software utility designed to sample passwords from large breached password datasets that comply with a set of password policies. [Check it out on GitHub...](https://github.com/sr-lab/ampasamp)

## Capitalizer
Capitalizer is a capital letter (and symbol) heat-mapper and password capitalisation utility. This repo is a bit of a mix, and contains several projects. [Check it out on GitHub...](https://github.com/sr-lab/capitalizer)
