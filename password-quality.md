# Password Quality
A number of utilities we use for research into password quality/strength are listed below. [

## Ampasamp
Ampasamp (**a** **m**inimal **pa**ssword **samp**ler) is a software utility designed to sample passwords from large breached password datasets that comply with a set of password policies. [Check it out on GitHub...](https://github.com/sr-lab/ampasamp)

## Capitalizer
Capitalizer is a capital letter (and symbol) heat-mapper and password capitalisation utility. This repo is a bit of a mix, and contains several projects. [Check it out on GitHub...](https://github.com/sr-lab/capitalizer)

## Entropy Calculator
Extensible batch password entropy calculator. This utility will take a text files as input and calculate some score for each string contained in it, one per line. [Check it out on GitHub...](https://github.com/sr-lab/entropy-calculator)

## Guesser
Sometimes you just need a super-simple list-based password guesser that will take a plaintext list of guesses, a plaintext list of attacks and tell you how many guesses you got right. Takes two lists, one of guesses and one to be guessed, and tells you how many matches turn up. Does some other small stuff like deduplicating guesses.
